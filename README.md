Artifact for our OOPSLA 2025 paper "Scaling Instruction-Selection Verification
with Authoritative ISA Semantics in an Industrial WebAssembly Compiler".

TODO

## Hardware Dependencies

This artifact requires a single x86 host machine. While there is no strict
requirement for many cores, the Arrival verifier parallelizes over available
cores, and reviewers will have a better time with at least 8 and ideally more
cores.

## Getting Started Guide

### Setup [est. 10-30 minutes]

We provide our artifact as a
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) instance. Please install
Docker based on your system's instructions.

Build the `arrival` Docker image from the root of the artifact as follows:

```
docker build -t arrival .
```

### Basic Test [est. 5 minutes]

Run the container:
```
docker run -it arrival
```

Verify a simple lowering of the integer addition `iadd` instruction, execute
within the container:
```
./script/veri.sh -- --filter rule:iadd_base_case
```

This will build the verifier, and run it against all expansions of the
`iadd_base_case` rule. In this case there is only one expansion, and four
applicable type instantiations. You should see output similar to:

```
#111    iadd_base_case
        iadd({bits: int}, bv 8, bv 8) -> bv 8
                type solution status = solved
                applicability = applicable
                verification = success
        iadd({bits: int}, bv 16, bv 16) -> bv 16
                type solution status = solved
                applicability = applicable
                verification = success
        iadd({bits: int}, bv 32, bv 32) -> bv 32
                type solution status = solved
                applicability = applicable
                verification = success
        iadd({bits: int}, bv 64, bv 64) -> bv 64
                type solution status = solved
                applicability = applicable
                verification = success
        iadd({bits: int}, bv 128, bv 128) -> bv 128
                type solution status = solved
                applicability = inapplicable
```

## Step by Step Instructions

> In the Step by Step Instructions, explain how to reproduce any experiments or
> other activities that support the conclusions in your paper. Write this for
> readers who have a deep interest in your work and are studying it to improve it
> or compare against it. If your artifact runs for more than a few minutes, point
> this out, note how long it is expected to run (roughly) and explain how to run
> it on smaller inputs. Reviewers may choose to run on smaller inputs or larger
> inputs depending on available resources.
>
> Be sure to explain the expected outputs produced by the Step by Step
> Instructions. State where to find the outputs and how to interpret them relative
> to the paper. If there are any expected warnings or error messages, explain
> those as well. Ideally, artifacts should include sample outputs and logs for
> comparison.

### Reproduce `sdiv` Bug [est. 5 mins]

To reproduce the `sdiv` bug discussed in Section 2.4 "Bug Discovery with
Arrival", first run the docker container:

```
docker run -v .:/root/artifact -it arrival
```

Since the bug has now been fixed, revert the change to reintroduce the error:
```
patch -R -p1 -d /root/arrival/ -i /root/artifact/data/sdiv_fix.patch
```

Run verification against the `sdiv` rule:
```
./script/veri.sh -- --filter rule:sdiv
```

After a few seconds, you should see a verification error as well as the values
of all intermediate terms in a counterexample, such as below (trimmed for brevity).

```
#416    sdiv
        sdiv({bits: int}, bv 8, bv 8) -> bv 8
                type solution status = solved
                applicability = applicable
                verification = failure
model:
state: fpcr = #x0000000000000000
state: clif_load = {active: false, size_bits: 0, addr: #x0000000000000000}
state: isa_store = {active: false, size_bits: 1, addr: #x0000000000000000, value: #x0000000000000000}
state: loaded_value = #x0000000000000000
state: clif_store = {active: false, size_bits: 1, addr: #x0000000000000000, value: #x0000000000000000}
state: exec_trap = false
state: clif_trap = true
state: isa_load = {active: false, size_bits: 0, addr: #x0000000000000000}
has_type({bits: 8}, #x00) -> #x00
fits_in_64({bits: 8}) -> {bits: 8}
sdiv({bits: 0}, #x80, #xff) -> #x00
...
MInst.Extend(#xffffffffffffffff, #x00000000000000ff, true, #x08, #x40) -> {flags_in: {N: #b0, Z: #b0, C: #b0, V: #b0}, flags_out: {N: #b0, Z: #b0, C: #b0, V: #b0}}
emit({flags_in: {N: #b0, Z: #b0, C: #b0, V: #b0}, flags_out: {N: #b0, Z: #b0, C: #b0, V: #b0}}) -> #b1
lower(#x00) -> #x80
Error: verify expansion: 416

Caused by:
    verification failed
```

Note that the state variables `clif_trap` and `exec_trap` tell us that this
counterexample would trap in CLIF semantics, but not in the lowered
instructions. The inputs to the `sdiv` term also show us concrete inputs that
trigger the bug.

### Verify AArch64 Instruction Selection Rules [est. 15-60 mins]

Run the container:
```
./script/docker_run.sh
```

Within the container, invoke the evaluation verification run (in CI mode):
```
./script/verify/eval.sh -n artifact -c -t 60
```

The options provided to the evaluation script specify the name `artifact` for
the verification run (`-n artifact`), enable CI mode (`-c`) and use a timeout of
60 seconds (`-t 60`).

This command will take a while to run. More cores will help, since Arrival
processes expansions in parallel.

While this is running you should see log output as it processes expansions, for example:
```
...
[2025-06-23T21:34:01Z INFO ] #1857      ishl_64
[2025-06-23T21:34:01Z INFO ] #2043      icmp
[2025-06-23T21:34:01Z INFO ] #1903      sshr_64
[2025-06-23T21:34:01Z INFO ] #1950      clz_16
[2025-06-23T21:34:01Z INFO ] #1486      sextend_load
[2025-06-23T21:34:01Z INFO ] #650       uextend_load
...
```

A complete dump of results will be written under the `$EVAL_DATA_DIR/run`
directory mounted in the container (`data/eval/run` of the artifact).
Specifically, it will be written to a directory called `<timestamp>-artifact`,
where `artifact` comes from the name option (`-n`) provided above.
Locate the results directory by running:
```
ls -1d $EVAL_DATA_DIR/run/*-artifact
```

**TODO:** generating a graph

### Generate ISA Specifications [est. 10 mins]

Run the container:
```
docker run -it arrival
```

Generated specifications are checked in to the Cranelift codebase. You can
locate them with:
```
grep -lR 'GENERATED BY `isaspec`' /root/arrival/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/aarch64/spec/
```

To confirm the code generation works from scratch, first delete the generated files:
```
grep -lR 'GENERATED BY `isaspec`' /root/arrival/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/aarch64/spec/ | xargs rm -v
```

Generate them using the following script:
```
cd ../isaspec
./script/generate.sh -l
```

This will build the ISA specification generation tooling, launch a server to
communicate with SymASLp symbolic executor, and run the code generator on
configured instruction families. You should see log output like the following
(trimmed for brevity):
```

Disassembling '0xaa0600a4'
...

Disassembling '0x4e31b8a4'
Disassembling '0x2e31a8a4'
Disassembling '0x0e31b8a4'
```

Upon completion, you should see that the ISA specification ISLE files have been
regenerated, as before:
```
grep -lR 'GENERATED BY `isaspec`' /root/arrival/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/aarch64/spec/
```
